         <h1>C ++ programming training</h1>
         <p style="text-align: justify;">Learning a programming language expands our view of computer science. On the other hand, programming teaches us how to think. The popularity of C ++ is very high among programming languages ​​and can be learned as a first language and no longer need prerequisites.
            C ++ programming is more powerful than C. Things can be done that in C (if possible) require more effort. C ++ language is taught in two parts. In the first part (the same set) the commands and data structure are introduced and in the second part the concepts of object-orientation will be taught.</p>
