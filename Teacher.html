    <h1>1.Kevin Mitnik</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">After serving a year in prison for hacking the Digital Equipment Corporation network, he was released from prison for three years under surveillance, but was involved in computer sabotage for about 2.5 years. This big hacker was able to penetrate the network of the US National Defense Organization at that time, and the theft of information of large commercial companies is also seen in the case of ethnic hacks.</p>

   <h1>2.Albert Gonzalez</h1>
   <p style="text-align: justify;">Gonzalez was able to collect more than 170 million credit card numbers in two years. He then hacked into the databases of TJX Companies and Heartland Payment Systems and stole all of their credit card numbers.</p>
   <p style="text-align: justify;">He started his hacking business with the leadership of a group called ShadowCrew. He also had a long history of stealing credit card information. The history of Gonzalez hacking and crimes does not end here, and this hacker has forged passports, insurance cards, as well as identity cards in his file.</p>

   <h1>3.Kevin Paulsen</h1>
   <p style="text-align: justify;">Paulsen is in trouble for infiltrating the Afbibia network and stealing the agency's information. Poulsen was eventually arrested while shopping at a supermarket and sentenced to 51 months in prison and a $ 56,000 fine.</p>
   <p style="text-align: justify;">Also known as Dark Dante. Poulsen is well known for his influence on telecommunications systems. It is interesting to know that Poulsen managed to hack the lines of a radio station and established himself as the winner of a Porsche car. The whole process took just 15 minutes, and the media dubbed Poulsen "Hannibal Lecter of the Computer World."</p>

   <h1>4.Gary McKinnon</h1>
   <p style="text-align: justify;">In a 13-month period between 2001 and 2002, McKinnon illegally accessed 97 computers belonging to NASA and the US military. He claims his goal was only to gain access to information that the US government has kept secret from space humans, as well as access to free energy from humans. But the coin has another side, and US officials believe he deleted many important files, shut down 300 computers and caused about $ 700,000 in damage.</p>

   <p style="text-align: justify;">The group continues its hacking activities, and since 2011 two important groups, LulzSec and AntiSec, have branched out from Anonymous.

   <h1>6.Gossip</h1>
   <p style="text-align: justify;">During the 2016 US presidential election, the Democratic National Convention Network was hacked and we saw thousands of documents posted on WikiLeaks and other websites. Many believe that the Russian spy agency used the name Gossiper 2.0 to cover up its actions, but in an interview with Vice, Gossiper 2.0 claimed that he had no connection with Russia. No, and he is of Romanian descent.</p>
